# inventory-tracker

a simple web app built with flask and python.

To add new items to the inventory, simply hit the 'add new item' button.

To update any item from the inventory, add /item ID/update, ex. https://inventory-tracker.herokuapp.com/data/3/update
  
Then hit submit when done updating.
  
To delete an item, add /item ID/delete, ex. https://inventory-tracker.herokuapp.com/data/3/delete
  
A safegaurd statement is shown, hit 'YES' to confirm the deletion, and 'Cancel' to cancel it.
  
Thanks!
